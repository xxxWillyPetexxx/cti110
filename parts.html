  <h2>CPU</h2>
    <p> 
      CPU, the central processing unit. Its job is to execute instructions for software running on your computer. The main brands for CPUs are Intel and AMD, and choosing one comes down to which one fits your needs and budget.<br />
      Intel and AMD products aren't interchangeable, as they use different sockets to connect with the motherboard. Importantly for consumers are core and thread count. All CPUs have cores, but recent CPUs split each core into two virtual cores called threads, adding up to<br /> 
      cores called threads, adding up to 30% extra performance. More cores make more applications run smoothly on your system at the same time. So, if you're streaming on Twitch using broadcasting software while playing a game, you'll need a CPU with more cores and threads.<br />

  <h2>GPU</h2>
    <p>
      A graphics card, or GPU, a graphical processing unit, is an expansion card that fits into the PCIe slot on your motherboard. It handles complex graphical instructions, computing images, textures, and objects, and sends<br /> 
      the result to one or more monitors. Your motherboard may have HDMI, DisplayPort, or older DVI or VGA ports, driven by the integrated graphics GPU inside some processors. It handles basic desktop applications just fine, but it's nowhere near the performance of a dedicated<br /> 
      graphics card to game at the highest FPS and with details cranked to the max.<br />
    </p>
  <img src="img/motherboard.jpg" alt="Motherboard" height="400" width="200">
  <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>
      For a given CPU, there's often a choice of chipsets that support it. The chipset provides options and connectivity on the motherboard, and higher priced chipsets offer you more features. There's a lot of different<br /> 
      chipsets, so to simplify, the higher the chipset number, the more functionality your motherboard will have. Intel and AMD CPUs have their own chipsets, so when you find a match, you can search to find all the different options. For example, Intel's 12th gen CPUs work<br /> 
      with H610, B660, H670 and Z690 chipsets. Z690 could support CPU and memory overclocking, while B660 could support memory overclocking. For AMD, high-end Ryzen CPUs should get a B550 or X570 chipset. You can pair mid or entry level with B550, or older X470 or B450 chipsets.<br />
      All AMD AM4 and Ryzen CPUs are overclockable, and motherboard memory is too, available on almost all matching motherboards<br />

  <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p>
      RAM allows your operating system to hold more data in a very quick access area, instead of having to access it from slower storage devices. The latest desktop version is DDR5, which is useful for a snappier responding<br /> 
      PC. Also, the RAM can come with RGB lighting on top to match your build and theme. On to the amount of RAM you need. Too little RAM makes your system slow, and while Windows minimum spec lists 2 gigabytes or gigs, realistically you need 8 gigs of RAM. We'd recommend 16<br /> 
      gigs of memory, as with Windows installed on an NVMe m.2 drive, your system can boot in under 20 seconds and is snappy and responsive. And if you're doing photo or video editing, 32 or 64 gigs paired with a powerful CPU will give shorter rendering times. Between the<br />  
      amount of RAM you have and its speed, how much you have has the most impact up to about 16 gigabytes. Gamers will want fast RAM, so check benchmark comparisons to see the benefit in your game, as the highest speed RAM can be pricey.<br />

  <h2>Powersupply</h2>
    <p>
      Power supply, or PSU, is important when building your PC, as it converts AC into DC power for your CPU, motherboard, graphics card and all peripherals. General guidelines- a PC for the web, word and excel can get by on<br />
      500 to 600 watts. Check your PSU has enough connectors, some motherboards have dual ATX 8pin or an 8 plus 4 design for CPU power, so choose one with dual ATX 8pin for future upgrade-ability, as most older models don't. Also, your graphics cards will need dual, even triple<br />
      6+2 PCI power connectors, but most PSUs have this. The 80 plus bronze, silver, gold, platinum and titanium ratings have 2 to 3 percent efficiency gains between tiers, starting with bronze at 82 percent, and titanium having 92% efficiency, though that comes with a price.<br />
      Modular power supplies can reduce cable clutter in your build and can make wiring components and cable management easier. And note that CPU and PCI 6+2 connectors may look the same, but they won't fit each other's sockets. With these tips, you should be able to easily pick your new PSU.<br />

  <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Whether we're talking hard disk drives, solid state drives or SSDs, or NVMe or SATA m.2 drives, these are all forms of storage for files in your computer. Storage has evolved from hard drives that use magnetic technology<br />
      to store data on spinning disks. Reaching 20 terabytes or more, 4 to 8 terabyte hard drives are a cost-effective option for mass storage. But, with data transfer around 140 to 180 megabytes a second, speed is far surpassed by SSDs and m.2 drives. Solid state drives, whether SSDs or M.2 drives,<br /> 
      use memory to store data. Whereas the DDR4 memory in your computer is emptied when there's no power, SSDs and M.2 drives can store data without power. For SSDs, they use the same SATA connectors as hard drives, but good drives offer read and write speeds of over 500 megs a second, triple the<br /> 
      speed of hard drives. These go up to 2 terabyte capacities, some reaching 4 terabytes.<br />

  <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>
      Selecting a case can be done mostly to personal taste, but there's a few factors to keep in mind. First, the case needs to have good airflow, so there should be lots of fan mounting spots. Also look for wide openings at the<br />
      front for air to enter, and having them filtered will help keep dust out of the case. Second, check what size motherboard your case will accept, most motherboards are ATX sized and won't fit in smaller cases.<br />
    </p>
  <h2>Peripherals</h2>
    <p>
      Bellow you will see a brief overview of a few peripherals you can purchase for you computer:<br /> 
      <img src="keyboard.jpg" alt="keyboard" height="150" width="200">
      <strong>Keyboard</strong><br />
      On to Keyboards, there's membrane keyboards, which are cheaper and make up a lot of the market, and high-end mechanical keyboards. Both can have gaming features like anti-ghosting and N-key rollover where the keyboard<br />
      registers N number of keys pressed simultaneously.<br />
      <img src="mouse.jpg" alt="mouse" height="150" width="200">
      <strong>Mouse</strong><br />
      Mice have sensors to track dots per inch or DPI under the mouse, the higher the DPI, the more sensitive the mouse is, and the quicker the cursor can move on screen.<br />
      <img src="monitor.jpg" alt="monitor" height="150" width="200">
      <strong>Monitor</strong><br />
      A monitor connects with one DisplayPort or HDMI cable, and high-end models may have a USB-C video input. Often there's legacy VGA, also known as D-Sub, or DVI inputs. Monitors can be flat or curved, and 1080p is the basic<br />
      resolution, but 1440p is becoming the gamers choice as you can see more game detail. There are 4K screens for high resolution media playback, and creative professionals. Refresh rate is important for gamers; most 1080p and 4K screens have a 60 hertz refresh rate, but 1440p can do 120 or 144<br /> 
      hertz, this is often a TN type display. Your display can update twice as fast, and the split-second difference may help you win competitive online games. AMD Freesync or NVIDIA G-sync features can reduce screen tearing. You should pay attention to contrast and especially brightness, which is<br />
      rated in candala or nits, same thing. Panel type can be In-Plane Switching or IPS, with better color accuracy and wider viewing angles, or Twisted Nematic or TN, known for its ultra-fast refresh rate. Vertical Alignment or VA panels used to sit in-between these two, though newer AMVA panels have<br />
      improved colors, contrast and refresh rates, and are found in curved and ultrawide gaming displays.<br />
