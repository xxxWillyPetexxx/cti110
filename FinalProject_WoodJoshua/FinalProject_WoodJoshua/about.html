    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Just wanted to take some time and tell you a little bit about myself.<br />
            Growing up, I was never really interested in computers. My grandfather was a computer<br />
            programmer and also built computers on the side, but other than the few times I went to his<br />
            house, I never really interacted with a computer outside of school. It wasn't until I was about<br />
            26 years old when I really started to learn how computers worked and became interested in computer gaming.<br />
            Right then and there I became hooked and entered into the world of computer building. My first gaming<br />
            I built was not very good. I did not do very good research before I purchased parts and really didn't invest<br />
            time in watching benchmarks, I just remember being so excited to finally build my first computer<br /> 
            Well, 7 years later and probably 2 - 3 dozen custom built computers under my belt, I finally feel comfident<br />
            enough to share my knowlegde and hopefully help a few people so they dont make the same mistakes I did<br />
            when I built my first computer.
